# Sippi Ordering App

This is a project for course PRG2104 Object Oriented Programming (Sunway University). It is a menu ordering system for a drink pop-up store named “Sippi” that specialises in iced drinks like milk tea and matcha latte. The system designed for Sippi contains a user application that the user can interact to choose and place drink orders, and a database system that is inaccessible to the user but for the staff to see the orders that are placed. The inspiration for this project was to hone object-oriented programming skills in designing a simple method of ordering menu items.

The system utilises Scala (with some Java aspects) for the programming of the user application. There is basic CSS included that handles the visual design of the app to match the theme of Sippi. Furthermore, SQL queries are written for the management of the database – in this case Apache Derby is used. IntelliJ Idea was the IDE of choice, while DataGrip was used for handling database.
